Feature: Workouts
  Coaches plan training from their athletes' workouts.

  @R1
  Rule: Coaches see only their group's workouts

    @B1.1
    Example: A workout from another group
      Given coach Anna leads group A
      And Carl from group B logged a workout
      When Anna opens Carl's workout
      Then she gets "not found"

    @B1.2
    Example: A workout from her own group
      Given coach Anna leads group A
      And Ben from group A logged a workout
      When Anna opens Ben's workout
      Then she sees it

  @R2
  Rule: Athletes see only their own workouts

    @B2.1
    Example: Another athlete's workout
      Given Carl logged a workout
      When athlete Ben opens Carl's workout

  Rule: Only admins delete workouts

    @B3.1

      Given Ben logged a workout
      When coach Anna deletes it

      And the workout still exists
